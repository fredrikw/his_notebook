#### G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>2</sub> βγ subunit signaling
Gα<sub>i2</sub> dependent activation of PI-PLC<sub>β2</sub> as described in [Camps:1992a][Camps:1992a] and [Camps:1992b][Camps:1992b] leads to the degradation of PtdInsP<sub>2</sub> to IP<sub>3</sub> and diacylglycerol (DAG). The former will in turn initiate release from internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> depots (prob. from ER) into the cytosol, while the latter will activate protein kinase C (PKC). The IP<sub>3</sub> effect can be inhibited by 2-APB

####Gα<sub>q</sub>
Gα<sub>q</sub> has been shown to be essential for the chemotactic effect of fMLF in mouse neutrophils ([Shi:2007][Shi:2007]). This effect is also dependent on CD38/cADPR and can therefor be blocked with the cADPR antagonist 8Br-cADPR. The Shi paper doesn't describe the pathway in detail, but it is responsible for the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cell. According to their experiments, signaling through G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>2</sub> (or other Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins) will release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal depots (ER?) in a quick spike, while the G<sub>q</sub>/CD38 dependent signaling will give a more sustained influx of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
