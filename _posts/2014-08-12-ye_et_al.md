This entry will consist of a reread the FPR review from [Ye et.al.][Ye:2009] where they set the nomenclature on FPRs since that is a good review also on a lot of info on the different FPR species.  

Summary of what was gathered and further readings.

* G protein
	* a large body of evidence indicates that the fMLF-induced responses require physical association of FPR1 with PTX-sensitive G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>2</sub> protein in leukocytes (Bommakanti et al., [1992][Bommakanti:1992], [1993][Bommakanti:1993], [1994][Bommakanti:1994], [1995][Bommakanti:1995]; [Schreiber et al., 1993][Schreiber:1993]). (p.144)
	* p.143: [Amatruda et al. (1991)][Amatruda:1991] demonstrated that the cofactor might be G16, a pertussis toxin-**insensitive** G protein of the Gq class. This is most likely due to the fact that G16 is a promiscuous G protein that couples to a wide variety of GPCRs. (fMLF-mediated functional responses in leukocytes are largely inhibited by treatment with PTX, which inhibits G<sub>i</sub> class of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits (p.144))
	* p.143: PI-PLC<sub>β2</sub> is activated by the βγ subunits of G proteins, such as Gα<sub>i2</sub> (Camps et al., [1992a][Camps:1992a],[1992b][Camps:1992b])
	* p.144: mouse Fpr1, along with a number of chemokine receptors known to couple to the G<sub>i</sub> proteins, can also couple to Gα<sub>q</sub> ([Shi et al., 2007][Shi:2007])
		* Responsible for an alternative pathway for the activation of chemoattractant and chemokine receptors that leads to chemotaxis.
	* p.144: FPR1 activates the Gα<sub>i</sub> proteins linearly and not catalytically ([Wenzel-Seifert et al., 1999][WenzelSeifert:1999])
* FPR phosphorylations
	* p.145: It has been shown that FPR1 is rapidly phosphorylated in an agonist concentration- and time-dependent manner ([Ali et al., 1993][Ali:1993]; [Tardif et al., 1993][Tardif:1993])
		* Not by PKC
	* p.145: The carboxyl tail of FPR1 contains a total of 11 serine and threonine residues. Eight of these residues, located between and including Ser328 and Thr339, are found to be critical to FPR1 internalization and desensitization ([Maestes et al., 1999][Maestes:1999]).
	* p.146: GRK2 has been identified as the primary kinase that phosphorylates FPR1 ([Prossnitz et al., 1995a][Prossnitz:1995tj])
	* The phosphorylation of Ser328, Ser332, and Ser338 is critical to FPR1 internalization and desensitization as well as β-arrestin 2 binding ([Potter et al., 2006][Potter:2006]).
	* The phosphorylation status of modulates the affinity of FPR1 for β-arrestins and agonists ([Key et al., 2003][Key:2003], [2005][Key:2005]).
		* The sequence D<sup>328</sup>STQTS<sup>332</sup> controls the affinity for β-arrestins
		* Phosphorylation of D<sup>333</sup>TATNST<sup>339</sup> renders the β-arrestin-bound FPR1 able to form a high-affinity ternary complex with the ligand.
	* Like FPR1, FPR2 is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner, but little is known about the nature of the kinase(s) involved in the process.
	* In contrast to FPR1 and FPR2/ALX, FPR3 displays a marked level of phosphorylation in the absence of stimulation ([Christophe et al., 2001][Christophe:2001]).
	* In the current model, liganded GPCRs are phosphorylated and form a high affinity complex with β-arrestin 1 or 2. The β-arrestins are thought to sterically interfere with G protein coupling and thereby inhibit the signaling capacity of the receptor.
	* p.146: However, fMLF-induced phosphorylation of FPR1 can **block FPR1 interaction with G proteins independently of β-arrestin** ([Bennett et al., 2001][Bennet:2001]).
	* p.146: Two studies ([Huet et al., 2007][Huet:2007], [Gripentrog and Miettinen, 2008][Gripentrog:2008]) have led to the conclusion that FPR1 and FPR2 mediated ERK activation occurs through Gα<sub>i</sub> and is not affected by β-arrestins, in contrast to GPCRs coupled to G<sub>q</sub> or G<sub>s</sub>
* Internalization
	* p.146: After prolonged stimulation with fMLF, FPR1 was found to colocalize with β-arrestin 1 and 2 in endocytic vesicles
	* p.147: FPR1 can interact with different components of the endocytic machinery in a β-arrestin-independent manner. However, phosphorylation of liganded FPR1 is a prerequisite for the internalization whether the two β-arrestins are present or not. [Kohout et al., 2001][Kohout:2001]
	* p.147: In contrast to FPR1, FPR2 undergoes clathrin-mediated and dynamin-dependent endocytosis
		* p.147: the internalization of FPR2, expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both β-arrestins, was highly compromised ([Huet et al., 2007][Huet:2007])
