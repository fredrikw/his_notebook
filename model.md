description: Current model of the signaling between FPR and NOX2

The data gathered in this project is continuously entered into a model in [Cell Designer](http://celldesigner.org) to get an overview of what is learned and to form the basis of future modeling efforts, where the goal is to set up a logical model of the neutrophil response to FPR agonists and the resulting ROS burst.

The current model can be downloaded (in SBML format) [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/media/FPR_2_NOX.xml), for previous versions, see [GitHub](https://github.com/fredrikw/his_notebook/commits/gh-pages/assets/media/FPR_2_NOX.xml).
