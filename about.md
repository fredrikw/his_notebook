[!wiki:Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)] produced among others by the [!wiki:phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2)] are traditionally seen as harmful due to their highly reactive nature. More recently there are however more and more accepted that they in addition are very competent signaling molecules in a variety of events. In 2002 [Olofsson et. al.][Olofsson:2002ed] showed that reduced capacity to produce ROS through NOX2 lead to an aggravated disease in a rat model of arthritis. In the following years, more and more evidence has been found pointing to a correlation between impaired NOX2 function and disease severity in [!wiki:autoimmunity].

The Swedish biotech company [Redoxis][http://www.redoxis.se/?_utg_campaign=his_notebook] was formed to explore the implications of this correlation in treatment of disease and Redoxis has developed and [patented][Wallner:vq] compounds that can trigger NOX2-dependent ROS production and treat animals.

The NOX2 complex can be triggered by a multitude of signals. One of them is the [!wiki:formyl peptide receptors (FPR)], a family of receptors found on leukocytes and known to be involved in inflammation and host defense. Even though it is known that FPR signaling can trigger NOX2, the exact nature of that signaling pathway is not known. In this project, we will try to summarize the known literature to capture the different possible pathways, create a logical model of the signaling, and finally test the model by studying the effects of diverse inhibitors in a set of *in vitro* experiments.
